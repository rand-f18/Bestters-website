        <h1> Our Services</h1>

        <h2>DayCare</h2>
        <h3>In a daycare babysitting, your child is not only provided with care during the day.<br>
            Aside from giving them a safe and secure environment while parents and guardians like you study or work.<br>
            In our programs — particularly those for toddlers, and preschoolers — we work to equip kids with the essential skills they need.<br>
            Furthermore, daycare babysitters are certified and experienced to give hands-on and age-appropriate learning experiences.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Overnight babysitting</h2>
        <h3>An overnight babysitter is a sitter who stays at the house while the children are asleep. This usually means<br>
            the parents are expected back very late or even into the next morning or afternoon so they ask you to sleep<br>
            over at the house. Then you’re “on the clock” and in charge of the kids until the parents return.</h3>
        <br>

        <h2>Infant babysitting</h2>
        <h3>It’s hard work caring for infants. Are you prepared? You shouldn’t accept the responsibility of caring for an<br>
            infant under 6 months old until you’ve had at least two years’ experience with older babies and children, but<br>
            even infants 6 months and older need extra care and attention. What makes babysitting for infants so much<br>
            different than caring for an older child?</h3>
        <br>

        <h2>Special needs</h2>
        <h3>A special needs babysitter looks after a child or infant with a physical, mental, or emotional disability, such as<br>
            autism, for short periods of time to give the primary caregiver, such as the parent, nanny, or nurse some time<br>
            off. As a special needs babysitter, your duties and responsibilities may be to watch the child, providing care<br>
            such as feeding, changing, or administering medication.</h3>
        <br>

        <h2>Homework Helper</h2>
        <h3>Demanding work schedules and other responsibilities often keep parents away from home during those<br>
            important after-school and evening hours when children need to do homework. Even students who work well<br>
            independently need some structure and guidance, and struggling students may require even more. Ofcourse,<br>
            hiring both an after-school nanny or sitter and a tutor can be costly. So why not save money by hiring a sitter<br>
            who can also provide help with homework? </h3>
